# Server Shell
Server (as in Minecraft Server) Shell (as in *the hard protective outer case of a mollusk or crustacean*) is a project
that sets up a very lightweight process that appears to be a Minecraft server to 
scrapers/`masscan` users, but in reality is impossible to join. 

The goals of this project are twofold:
 * Mess/get in touch with some scrapers
 * Learn more about network programming in Java (it's shockingly nice, despite the endless 
`DataClassReaderOutputStream`-type abstractions)
